  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # rules and activating additional ones.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/kids_learning_image/
    - assets/kids_learning_image/tools_img/
    - assets/
    - assets/avatar/
    - assets/new_ui_images/
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: BeVietnamProBold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/BeVietnamPro-Bold.ttf

    - family: BeVietnamProSemiBold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/BeVietnamPro-SemiBold.ttf

    - family: BeVietnamProMedium
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/BeVietnamPro-Medium.ttf

    - family: BeVietnamProLight
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/BeVietnamPro-Light.ttf

    - family: BeVietnamProRegular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/BeVietnamPro-Regular.ttf
    - family: BeVietnamProExtraLight
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/BeVietnamPro-ExtraLight.ttf
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
